		<h3>Reftection: 1</h3>
		<p>
			This project's main goal is to build a strong foundation in C programming, which is essential for understanding 
			computer networking. It involves learning key C programming concepts like socket programming, network protocols, 
			and security. By working on practical projects like setting up a self-hosted VPN or creating an email server, the 
			aim is to develop the skills needed to design and manage secure and efficient network systems. Ultimately, this 
			project aims to prepare me for careers in network administration, engineering, or cybersecurity by providing the 
			necessary knowledge and expertise.

		<h3>Reftection: 2</h3>
		<p>
			A whlile a back I started reading a book called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language">The C Programing Language</a> by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie who codesigned the unix
			operating system and designed the C language. I droped the book for no particular reason but now is a good opertunity to continue. I am
			also following <a href="https://beej.us/guide/bgc/html/split/">this</a> guide by Brian “Beej Jorgensen” Hall to learn C who is also author of <a href="https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/">Network Programing Using Internet Sockets</a> which I intend to referance in the future.
