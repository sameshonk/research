			<p>
				Pointers in C are variables that store memory addresses, allowing indirect access to data. They are a powerful 
				feature, often used to pass references to data structures, modify variables indirectly, and manage memory 
				efficiently by dynamically allocating and deallocating memory. Pointers enable low-level memory manipulation and are 
				a fundamental concept in C programming.
			</p>

			<p>
				The follwing C program illustrates the concept of pointers, a fundamental feature in the C programming language. In 
				this program, we have a main function and a helper function called increment.
			</p>

			<pre class="code">
<green>#include</green> <dgreen>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</dgreen>

<red>void</red> increment(<red>int</red> *p)  <grey>// note that it accepts a pointer to an int</grey>
{
	*p = *p + <lgreen>1</lgreen>;        <grey>// add one to the thing p points to</grey>
}

int main(<red>void</red>)
{
	<red>int</red> i = <lgreen>10</lgreen>;
	<red>int</red> *j = &i;  <grey>// note the address-of; turns it into a pointer to i</grey>

	printf(<blue>"i is %d\n"</blue>, <lgreen>i</lgreen>);        <grey>// prints "10"</grey>
	printf(<blue>"i is also %d\n"</blue>, *j);  <grey>// prints "10"</grey>

	increment(j);                  <grey>// j is an int*--to i</grey>

	printf(<blue>"i is %d\n"</blue>, i);        <grey>// prints "11"!</grey>
}			</pre>

			<p>
				In the main function, an integer variable 'i' is declared and initialized to 10. A pointer 'j' is also declared, and 
				it is assigned the address of 'i' using the & operator. This means that 'j' now points to the memory location of 'i'.
			</p>

	   	 	<pre class="code">
int main(<red>void</red>)
{
	<red>int</red> i = <lgreen>10</lgreen>;
	<red>int</red> *j = &i;</pre>

			<p>
				The program proceeds to print the value of 'i' using printf, resulting in the output "i is 10." It also prints the value 
				pointed to by 'j', which is the same as 'i', so it prints "i is also 10."
			</p>

			<pre class="code">
	printf(<blue>"i is %d\n"</blue>, <lgreen>i</lgreen>);
	printf(<blue>"i is also %d\n"</blue>, *j);</pre>

			<p>
				The next line calls the 'increment' function, passing 'j' as an argument. This function takes a pointer to an integer 
				and increments the value it points to by 1.
			</p>

			<pre class="code">
	increment(j);	</pre>

	    	<pre class="code">
<red>void</red> increment(<red>int</red> *p)
{
	*p = *p + <lgreen>1</lgreen>;
}			</pre>

			<p>
				Finally, after the 'increment' function call, the program prints the value of 'i' again using printf, which now prints "i is 
				11" because 'i' was modified by the 'increment' function. This demonstrates how changes made to the value pointed to by a 
				pointer affect the original variable it references, highlighting the power and utility of pointers in C.
