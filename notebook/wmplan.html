				<h2>A meh Windows Manager for Linux (mehwm)</h2>

			<p>
			  I plan to create a simple Linux window manager to strengthen my C programming
			  skills and familiarize myself with the Linux operating system. The primary
			  focus will be on understanding and implementing Xlib, a C library essential
			  for interacting with the X Window System, and potentially exploring xcb for
			  a more contemporary approach.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Beginning with basic window operations like creation, movement, and resizing,
			  I will gradually progress to more intricate features such as window stacking
			  and the integration of keyboard shortcuts for efficient window management.
			  I intend to improve the user experience by incorporating elements like window
			  decorations, title bars, and borders.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Documentation will be a key aspect of this undertaking, relying on online
			  tutorials, documentation, and community forums for guidance. Anticipating
			  challenges, I see them as opportunities to refine my problem-solving skills.
			  Engagement with the open-source community will be valuable for feedback and
			  insights.
