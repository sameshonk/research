				<h2>A meh Windows Manager for Linux (mehwm)</h2>

			<p>
				I want to try to creat a simple windows manager for linux. To do this I need
				to use the Xlib c library to incract with the Xorg display system. To test
				and view my wm I will use zypher which allows me to run nested Xorg sesions
				where I can use my wm. I will begin with with basic window operations like 
				creation, movement, and resizing, and then will progress to more intricate 
				features such as window stacking and the integration of keyboard shortcuts 
				for efficient window management. I intend to improve the user experience by 
				incorporating elements like window decorations, title bars, and borders.
